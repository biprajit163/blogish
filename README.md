# Blogish 
The Blogish Application is a Full stack application that uses Django Rest Framework for the backend and React.js for the front end. This app can be used on your computer or on your mobile, here is a deployed version of the app on heroku https://bips-blogish.herokuapp.com. This is not the finished product of this app, this is a beta version that tests if a user can make an account on this app and start posting blogs to the apps backend. Blogish is meant to be a Blogging application like Wix, squarespace, and tumbler. The minimum functionality of this app if for the user to be able to create an account and post their blogs there. Later on I will work on accessing each blogs and adding extra functionality like sharing the blog on other platforms and user authentication so the users password can be save.

### Technologies used
- React routers
- React markdown

This app is incomplete and if someone wanted to go to this website and test drive it they need to manually enter the routes
- https://bips-blogish.herokuapp.com = root directory

- https://bips-blogish.herokuapp.com/login = login page

### MVP
The user should be able to make an account login/logout and make blogs.
The functionality to edit the user profile, such as add picture and description, has not been implemented yet.


### Stretch goals and Future plans
The priority right now is to implement the missing featues such as editing user profile, make the search bar functional, improving user interaction with the website, and improving the design so it feels more like a modern site. The future goals is to implement user autenticity with django user-auth-tokens so that users can use email verification, have secure passwords etc ...
